# Salary Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing employee salary data across different departments within an organization. The primary goal is to calculate and compare the average salaries for each department, providing insights into compensation trends and helping to identify any disparities.

## Data Description
The dataset contains information about employees, including their ID, age, gender, department, and salary. The data is structured in a tabular format with the following columns:

## Objectives

### Calculate Average Salaries
Use Excel or Google Sheets to compute the average salary for each department.

### Data Cleaning
Ensure that the salary data is correctly formatted and free of errors (e.g., no leading/trailing spaces, correct data types).

### Visualization
Create visual representations (e.g., bar charts) to compare average salaries across departments.

### Insights and Recommendations
Analyze the results to provide insights into salary distribution and suggest any necessary adjustments or considerations for future salary reviews.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Excel/Google Sheets:** For data analysis and calculations.
- **Data Visualization Tools:** Excel charts or Google Sheets charts for visual representation of data.
